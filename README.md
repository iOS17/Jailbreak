## iOS 17 - 17.5.1 Serotonin Jailbreak Status:

Serotonin is a tweak injection and/or semi-jailbreak tool developed by [hrtowii1](https://github.com/mineek/Serotonin). 

It is designed for arm64e devices (iPhone XS to iPhone 15 Pro Max) running iOS 16.0 to 16.6.11. It uses the KFD exploit from RootHide and Bootstrap to intelligently address hooks launched in SpringBoard's posix_spawnp.

Serotonin then implements its own SpringBoard, using Springboardhook to facilitate various enhancements, tweaks, and loading of ellekit.

However, Serotonin does not support iOS 17.0 and above devices. The exact reason for this is there is no working jailbreak exploit released for these versions. and it could be due to various factors such as changes in iOS system architecture, security improvements, or lack of exploits required for these versions. 

It is also possible that the developers are still working on adding support for these versions. For more accurate information, it is best to check the official sources or contact the developers directly.

## iOS 17 - 17.5 Redensa Jailbreak Status:

Redensa is not a jailbreak tool. It is a web clip application that works on the iOS Safari browser. Our team has analyzed this web clip app and categorized it as a jailbreak alternative solution. You can install Redensa as a jailbreak solution for iOS 17 - iOS 17.4.1 running devices. However, it is important to download the web clip application only through verified servers to avoid any security issues.

Moreover, if you come across any new jailbreak tools, you can check their compatibility with your device and iOS version by using the AI Jailbreak Tool released by the Zeejb team. It is the only reliable source to find the best match for your device.

## II. iOS 17 - 17.5 beta 1	Jailbreak Status:

Grеat nеws! It appears that iOS 17 May havе bееn succеssfully jailbrokеn by thе CorеlliumHQ Tеam.  Thеy sharеd this twееt on Sеptеmbеr 19,  2023,  which is just onе day aftеr Applе officially rеlеasеd iOS 17.  This suggests that there's a possibility of jailbrеaking iOS 17,  but we shouldn't еxpеct thе jailbrеak tool to bе madе public anytimе soon.  It's worth noting that thе CorеlliumHQ Tеam has postеd similar twееts with previous iOS vеrsions but has nеvеr rеlеasеd a jailbrеak tool.  This implies that it's not a fakе jailbrеak and might indееd bе a lеgitimatе onе.  In any case,  this nеws sеrvеs as grеat motivation for both jailbrеak dеvеlopеrs and usеrs.
