## iOS 17 - 17.3 Serotonin Jailbreak Status:

Serotonin is a tweak injection and/semi-jailbreak tool developed by [hrtowii1](https://github.com/mineek/Serotonin). 

It is designed for arm64e devices (iPhone XS to iPhone 15 Pro Max) running iOS 16.0 to 16.6.11. It uses the KFD exploit from RootHide and Bootstrap to intelligently address hooks launched in SpringBoard's posix_spawnp.

Serotonin then implements its own SpringBoard, using Springboardhook to facilitate various enhancements, tweaks and loading of ellekit.

However, Serotonin does not support iOS 17.0 and above devices. The exact reason for this is there is no working jailbreak exploit released for these versions. and it could be due to various factors such as changes in iOS system architecture, security improvements or lack of exploits required for these versions. 

It is also possible that the developers are still working on adding support for these versions. For more accurate information, it is best to check the official sources or contact the developers directly.
